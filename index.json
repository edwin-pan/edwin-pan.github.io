On a whim, Anthony and I applied for the Half Dome Cable climb permits for Sunday, July 18th, 2021. This 10-14hr hike is considered one of the hardest hikes Yosemite has to offer. Word on the street was that the acceptance rate for permits is very low. To our surprise, one of our two lottery entries won! I had planned to exercise more in preparation for the hike… seems that wasn’t going to happen.\nWow! Won a slot on the first try. We proceeded to make plans for the drive. We would depart from the Bay Area around 1AM, arrive at the trailhead at 5AM, and proceed with the hike. However, hours before departure, we found out that there was a high likelihood of thunderstorms during our permit window.\nThat’s a lot of thunder… Faced with the prospect of missing our chance to hike to the top of Half Dome, Anthony and I decided to up the ante. We figured that if we moved up the departure to 9PM (i.e. an hour later at the time), we could make it to the trailhead by 1AM and have just enough time to speed hike before the thunderstorm arrived.\nAnd so it began! The trek to the top of Half Dome, starting around 2AM (due to some permit confusion)\nNight Lights Turns out red lights illuminate while preserving your night vision. The more you know! Can you hear the roar? There’s a water fall somewhere nearby. An actual paraphrased exchange between Anthony and I:\nA: Is that the waterfall?\nEdwin gets out his large handheld flashlight and illuminates the source of the sound, finding water hitting rock.\nE: Yea. That’s it. A: Where’s the top?\nGradually points the light higher.\nE: oh.\nand higher\nE: Ohh.\nand higher\nE: Ohhh…\nWe were right next to Vernal Falls, and it’s really really tall.\nTop of Vernal Falls And onwards we went, through the night,\nMist Trail \u0026gt; Yosemite Valley \u0026gt; Sub-Dome \u0026gt; …\nPre-Dawn Stillness First light! The iPhone certainly trying hard to compensate for the Poisson-distributed low-photon noise. Perhaps using TV prior? Algorithm seemed to think it was a lot brighter than it actually was at the time. Also, Half Dome sighted! Every minute it gets ever so gradually lighter! I think I’m at the point where you’re not supposed to look too far down. Summit Target in sight! Final stretch (then we can start heading home) I aspire to be like this tree. It’s growing on near-solid granite. Somehow, it found a way. Perk of hiking during ungodly hours: no people! Even a panoramic shot doesn’t do the sweeping view justice. Hello sunrise! The granite really is beautiful up close. Return This is the only photo I bothered to edit and filter. The way the cables aren’t in line with the horizon… quick reminder we’re on the top of a giant rock. Found a little redwood on the way back! Missed all the little ones in the darkness. Nevada Falls, during daytime. We took John Muir Trail (JMT) back. Few extra miles never hurt nobody. 20 miles, 10+hr later, all done! Photo doesn’t capture how tired I was very well Summary Summary graphic I made using good old Powerpoint. And that’s a wrap!\n","date":1626566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628640000,"objectID":"3047817f20ca8ff5e6284a22e731e8c6","permalink":"https://edwin-pan.github.io/post/halfdome/","publishdate":"2021-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/halfdome/","section":"post","summary":"20+ mile hike over the span of 10+ hours, starting at 2AM.
