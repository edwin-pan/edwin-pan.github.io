# About
I am a Senior Undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at The University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign Grainger College of Engineering. I'm part of the ECE Department's Inaugural Alchemy Deep Tech Incubator Cohort, working on a startup called PreSense. This has become my passion project, building out DSP stack capabilities for the next generation of MIMO mmWave Radar platforms to address wide ranging detection and perception needs in Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, and various other industries.

## Research Interests
I am interested in Signal Processing, Machine Learning, mmWave Radars, and MIMO systems.
