# About
I am a Senior Undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at The University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign [Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/). 

In January of 2019, I joined the ECE Department's Inaugural Alchemy Deep Tech Incubator Cohort. This new program is headed up by Professor Sanjay Patel (ECE, CSL), Professor Wen-mei Hwu (ECE, CSL), and co-director of the IBM Center for Cognitive Computing Systems ([C3SR](https://www.c3sr.com/)) Jinjun Xiong.

Together with four of my peers, we began work on a startup called PreSense. This company has become my passion project. At PreSense, I gain valuable experience building out DSP stack capabilities for the next generation of MIMO mmWave Radar platforms. This unique opportunity allows me to take the technical skills I learn in class and directly apply them to real world scenarios that address wide ranging detection and perception needs in Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, and various other industries.

## Research Interests
My research interests include Signal Processing, mmWave Radars, MIMO systems, Image Processing, and Machine Learning.
