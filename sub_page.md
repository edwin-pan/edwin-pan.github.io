# MIT-IBM AI Horizons Network 2019 AI Research Week

[AI Research Week](https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-research-week/) is hosted by MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in the Samberg Center on MIT's campus in Cambridge, Massacheusetts. Researchers from across IBM's many research endeavors come together to share results and ideas. Below is the poster I presented while representing PreSense through C3SR.
